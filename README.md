## Project Organization

The code for this project is divided across three branches: (1) `main` (current branch), which contains all of the data and analysis code; (2) `calibration`, which contains the software for the calibration experiment; and (3) `validation`, which contains the software for the validation experiment. 

The organization of the main branch (current branch) is as follows:

    ├── 01_Priors                   <- Data from pilot experiments.
    ├── 02_Design                   <- Parameter recovery studies for IRT models.
    ├── 03_Calibration              <- Data and code for the MaRs-IB calibration study. 
    ├── 04_Validation               <- Data and code for the MaRs-IB validation study. 
    ├── 05_Figures                  <- Figures for presentations & manuscript.
    ├── manuscript                  <- LaTeX code for the manuscript.
    ├── tutorials                   <- MaRs-IB item parameters, short forms, and optimal assembly tutorials.
